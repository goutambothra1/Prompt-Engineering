PROMPT 1:

Extract the food items from the restaurant review below:

Input:
It’s been 5 years since I left SF and my Hayes Valley Apartment right across the street from this cafe and I still think about the Pierogies and Honey Cake EVERY SINGLE DAY !

My daughter and I frequently visited this establishment with many fond memories.

This place is amazing !

PROMPT 2:

Classify the following text’s sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative

Input:
With it being listed as one of the Essential bakeries on the Eater list of bakeries in SF I came with quite an expectation but the place let me down in multiple ways. The menu had little variety and the items were hardly interesting. The pastry we had was also not that great. And for the price they charge the portion sizes are ridiculously small.

Skip this place if you are looking for a hearty breakfast or brunch

PROMPT 3:

Classify the following text’s sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative

Give me the Desired output only as a number as mentioned below

-1 for negative, 0 for neutral, and 1 for positive

Input:
Nice place with a European touch. Need to order at the register. My wife ordered pierogi ($8.5). I ordered an open bagle with smoked salmon ($12). Her plate had 2 pierogies, tasty but I can’t specify what the filler was. My Bagle was below average mostly because of old-like bagle. As much as I like salmon sandwiches this was a bit of a pain to chew.

PROMPT 4:

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, who is 5 years older than Erica. What is the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, if Erica is 30 years old ?

Let’s think step by step

PROMPT 6:

Text : I love ski so much. Today I went Skiing with my best friends and I fell really hard and broke 34 bones. I cried for hours. Now I am almost dead.

PROMPT 8:

Transform the following text to 3rd person female in the future tense 

Text : I love ski so much. Today I went Skiing with my best friends and I fell really hard and broke 34 bones. I cried for hours. Now I am almost dead.

PROMPT 9:

Transform each movie title to emojis

Cocaine Bear

PROMPT 10: To proofread for grammar, spelling and readability. 

I am absolutely obsessed with Stable Diffusion for image generation. MidJourney is great but Stable Diffusion let’s you create the EXACT image you’re looking for. However, to run it locally, you need a PC with a solid graphics card. Now, with RunDiffusion you can do everything you’d do with Stable DIffusion, but in the cloud, with amazing GPUs. I have Stable Diffusion locally installed but use RunDiffusion now instead because it’s faster that running it on my own computer.

Please proofread for grammar, spelling and readability. Then give me the list of changes that you made.

PROMPT 11: To summarize articles using bullet points of main ideas and important elements

Since OpenAI released its blockbuster bot ChatGPT in November, users have casually experimented with the tool, with even Insider reporters trying to simulate news stories or use it to message potential dates.
Its rapid adoption since then by some 100 million users in just its first two months is already changing how the internet will look and feel to users. With both Microsoft and Google incorporating generative AI into their search engines, it seems a matter of time before other websites adopt some kind of AI-driven interaction.
OpenAI's new features announced in May could get us there soon enough. Users of its ChatGPT Plus subscription service will be able to use dozens of plug-ins for other websites, and a web-browsing feature that will let them access more current information than the old data set that ChatGPT was trained on.
To older millennials who grew up with IRC chat rooms — a text instant message system — the personal tone of conversations with an AI bot can evoke the experience of chatting online. But ChatGPT, the latest in technology known as "large language model tools," doesn't speak with sentience and doesn't "think" the way people do.
That means that even though ChatGPT can explain quantum physics or write a poem on command, a full AI takeover isn't exactly imminent, according to experts.
